# Experimental Design and Data Collection Report

This folder contains a detailed report describing the experimental design,
data collection procedure, and hardware/software setup used for the EEG
neurohaptics study associated with this repository.

## Contents

- **mid_assessment_report.pdf**  
  A structured report covering:
  - Motivation and problem formulation in neurohaptics
  - EEG-based experimental design for active touch
  - Stimulus selection, trial structure, and bias control
  - Integration of EEG hardware (Emotiv EPOC X) with PsychoPy
  - Data collection protocol and quality assurance steps

## Purpose

This report is provided to give context to the EEG preprocessing pipeline
implemented in this repository. It explains how the raw EEG data was collected,
what assumptions were made during experimental design, and how these choices
influence downstream preprocessing and analysis.

The report is intended for documentation and research transparency.
