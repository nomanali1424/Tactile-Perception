# Behavioral Data Analysis

This directory contains notebooks for analyzing behavioral data collected
during the neurohaptics experiment, focusing on perceptual similarity ratings
provided by participants.

## Contents

- **Analysis.ipynb**  
  Preprocessing and statistical analysis of Likert-scale similarity ratings,
  including aggregation across trials and object pairs.

- **MDS_Analysis.ipynb**  
  Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis to construct perceptual embedding
  spaces of objects based on human similarity judgments. This analysis reveals
  inter-object relationships and perceptual structure.

## Purpose

These analyses provide behavioral context for the EEG data processed in this
repository. The derived perceptual representations can be used to interpret
neural patterns and study the relationship between human perception and EEG
responses during active touch.
